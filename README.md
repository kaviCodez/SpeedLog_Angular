# Angular8SpringbootClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Prerequisite:

We need to render Google maps using angular app, Hence we need the API key for the same,

Follow the steps mentioned below to create api key for google maps,

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Maps%20Platform%20%3E%20Credentials%20page.&text=On%20the%20Credentials%20page%2C%20click,Click%20Close.

Once the API-KEY is created the same has to be replaced in the application where 'api-key' string is mentioned.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
